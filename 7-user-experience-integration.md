# Project 2: User Experience & Integration Focus (team) : Fall 2019 CS4320/7320 Software Engineering

## Continue Groups from Last Assignment
In this exercise you will build a data visualization using data served up at this set of API Endpoints: 
1. http://augur.osshealth.io:5000/api/unstable/
2. The specific endpoints available are documented here: http://augur.osshealth.io/api_docs/
3. Your end product must be web deployable, and you can use any framework that allows you to call data from an API. Here is one example: https://twitter.github.io/year-in-review 
4. The source for the Twitter year in review site is here: https://github.com/sgoggins/twitter.github.io
5. There is a more complex and integrated strategy in the Augur project you have already cloned. 

## Details
1. Provide a visualization of total commits for each project that illustrates the proportion of commits each contributor is responsible for. http://augur.osshealth.io/api_docs/#api-Experimental-top_committers_repo
2. Provide a visualization of total pull request acceptance rate over time http://augur.osshealth.io:5000/api/unstable/repo-groups/24/repos/21623/pull-request-acceptance-rate 
3. Provide one other visualization. 
3. Class on October 15 is when we are reviewing this information and going over it.
